If we had a Single track curriculum to learn real world Clojure & ClojureScript development, just like how FreeCodeCamp does it for the JS world, then onboarding beginners and other hobbyists would be much more easy.</p><blockquote><p> Welcome fellow traveller! You don't seem to be from around here, do ya? </p><p> Oh I see, you have travelled far and wide from across the Nothern plains in  search for the one true paren, the paren to rule them all? </p><p> Take my heed o youngling, the paths beyond here are thorny and difficult. But  there's a secret... </p><p> Take this REPL. This is a wand of immense power; learn to use it, use it  wisely. The power of the REPL corrupts absolutely, don't let it consume you  lest you want to return back to the worlds of humankind. </p><p> Start your quest here to follow the paths of Clojure and find the one true  paren! </p></blockquote><p>Clojure Quest is my attempt to consolidate all learning resources under one roof, fill in the gaps myself, and make building real world Clojure apps fun and easy.</p><p>You can think of this as ‚ÄúClojure made easy‚Äú or ‚ÄúFreeCodeCamp but for Clojure & ClojureScript‚Äù üòâ</p><p>The courses will be divided into different ‚Äúquests‚Äù based on difficulty levels. So there should be something for both Clojure newbies and pros alike.</p><p><img src="https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/557/347/19f.gif" alt="" /></p><h2>Why?</h2><p>There is a <i>serious</i> barrier to entry in the Clojure ecosystem. Most of the clojure programmers are already quite experienced and don't really feel the pain of beginners or of those new to Clojure.</p><p>There is very little "content" around how to build say a full-stack production website, or how to use a particular library. I am already trying to contribute my bit through my YouTube channel: https://youtube.com/c/oxalorg (and I have so much more I want to post!)</p><p>There is also a branding, marketing, and <i>clojure adoption</i> issue at play here. I am not going to pretend I understand these things so I would rather just link to some conversations that have been happening in the community around this:</p><ul><li><a href='https://clojureverse.org/t/some-thoughts-about-clojure-its-latent-potential-and-adoption/8696/16'>https://clojureverse.org/t/some-thoughts-about-clojure-its-latent-potential-and-adoption/8696/16</a></li><li>https://www.reddit.com/r/Clojure/comments/t53hlt/some<i>thoughts</i>about<i>clojure</i>its<i>latent</i>potential/</li><li>Join the #growth channel in Clojurians log</li></ul><p>Hopefully in doing this we can drastically reduce the barrier to entry into the Clojure world.</p><h2>Can you give an example of a quest?</h2><p>Yes. Quests are scenarios you need to overcome.</p><p>Example quests:</p><blockquote><p> You have just joined $DEFN company. On your first day you get access to their  Clojure backend code and you notice there is no <code>project.clj</code> file. Oh noes!  They are using the new fancy kid on the block - tools.deps. You open up the  <code>deps.edn</code> file but are totally confused. You go on a quest to figure this  out! </p></blockquote><blockquote><p> You have just quit your job and want to start a SaaS company. You want to make  it big and get $5 trillion in VC funding. You go on a quest to build a Clojure  SaaS app with graphql / lacinia, re-frame, and XTDB. </p></blockquote><blockquote><p> After lots of hard work you managed to deploy a web app in Clojure. But every  time you change a few lines of code you hear a trembling voice echoing from  deep within your mind ~~~~~‚Äúthis might break‚Äù~~~~~~ but you push the code  anyways. One day you‚Äôve had enough. You want to conquer over your fears and  sleep well at night. You decide to go on a quest to learn to write integration  tests for your web service. </p></blockquote><p>Once we have a bunch of quests, there will be a larger story at play. Each quest will have a ‚Äúpre-requisite‚Äù quest to have completed, and a sequel quest to progress in the story. This is a journey you must take to find the hidden treasures on the Lambda Island.</p><h2>Will this be free? (Yes, for now)</h2><p>The aim is to allow individuals, hobbyists, enthusiasts, and students a complete and easy curriculum to follow. But at the same time also sell this ‚Äúbootcamp‚Äù service to companies so that they can train their new hires and juniors to get up to speed with Clojure quickly.</p><p>Having structured courses might take away some of the "fear" for both learners and companies and hopefully lead to more adoption.</p><p>I have no idea how I can keep this both free and paid simultaneously. If you are a Clojure company who is finding ways to train your new hires or existing employees, then please start a conversation with me (@oxalorg everywhere or mitesh@miteshshah.com)</p><p>But creating content is hard ‚ò†Ô∏è. Be it blog posts or screencasts! Most videos I create take me anywhere between 10-100 hours for 15 minutes worth of content.</p><p>Ideally I want to find a way to monetise this in a sustainable way, if you have ideas I would love to have a chat with you! Until I figure this out, all content WILL BE FREE.</p><p>UPDATE: An idea here could be to get funded by companies to create ‚Äúcustom quests‚Äù for them based on their tech stack.</p><h2>Will this be gamified?</h2><p>YES! Thank you for asking. I was waiting for this question.</p><p>I‚Äôve been a huge gamer all my life and I absolutely love the RPG talent / skill trees in games like The Witcher, Borderlands, or Torchlight; and technology trees in strategy games like Age of Empires and Civilisation.</p><p>I want to model learning in a tree format where you can choose your own path depending on which tree you want to progress in, but not give too much choice and have recommended paths to follow as well.</p><p>Want to become a badass frontend developer? No problem choose the ‚ÄúFrontend‚Äù tree alone and nothing else!</p><p>There will also be points to earn and level up your character in the future, I have not fletched this idea out well enough yet!</p><h2>Who are you?</h2><p>I‚Äôm Mitesh (internet handle @oxalorg) and I love writing, documentation, and have an unhealthy obsession with recording my screen all the time (I have a TB worth of recordings never published!!).</p><p>I create Clojure[script] screencasts on my [YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/c/oxalorg), do a lot of OSS work, and was also recently funded by ClojuristsTogether for building v2 of the clojurians log app.</p><p>Reach me at <a href='https://twitter.com/oxalorg'>Twitter</a> or in Clojurians slack channel (user <code>@oxalorg</code>) or email me at mitesh@miteshshah.com</p><p>I currently work with Gaiwan.co, a Clojure consultancy, where I have had the opportunity to work with several different real world Clojure codebases and learn immensely from them. We are also the team behind <a href='https://github.com/lambdaisland'>LambdaIsland</a>  and it‚Äôs popular OSS projects like <a href='https://github.com/lambdaisland/kaocha'>Kaocha</a>.</p><p>If you or your company needs Clojure or ClojureScript help, feel free to start a conversation with me & my colleagues at mitesh@gaiwan.co</p></div></div></main><footer class="quest_guide_layout__footer"><p class="love">Made with <img src="/imgs/icons/heart.png" /> by <a href="https://twitter.com/oxalorg">@oxalorg</a></p><div class="quest_guide_layout__sky"><div></div></div><div class="quest_guide_layout__ground"><div></div></div></footer></div></div><script type="application/javascript" src="/ui/main.6C04974C0D7D804A7188124BBDF90EF8.js"></script></body></html>
